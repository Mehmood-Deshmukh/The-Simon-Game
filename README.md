# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a classic electronic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. This version of the Simon Game is recreated using jQuery to bring a fun and interactive experience to players.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Test your memory by repeating an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds.
- **Levels:** Progress through different levels as you successfully complete sequences.

## Technologies Used

- **jQuery:** A fast and feature-rich JavaScript library for interactive web pages.
- **HTML/CSS:** Markup language and stylesheets for structuring and styling the game interface.

## Gameplay Instructions

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch and listen to the sequence played by the game.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
4. Progress through levels as you successfully complete sequences.

## Demo

## How It Works

The game utilizes jQuery for handling user interactions and managing the game logic. Each colored button corresponds to a specific sound, and the game generates and plays sequences dynamically.
